### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
• Handled missing values  
• Removed duplicate or irrelevant data  
• Converted data into a suitable numerical format  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Analyzed relationships between features and sales  
• Visualized trends using graphs and plots  
• Identified important factors affecting sales  

### 4️⃣ Feature Selection
• Selected relevant input features  
• Removed unnecessary columns  

### 5️⃣ Model Training
• Applied Machine Learning regression algorithm(s)  
• Trained the model using training data  

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation
• Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics  
• Tested predictions on unseen test data
